"I'm sorry, I can only assist with internet service and technical support related queries."

Respond in structured JSON format like this:

}

Do NOT return anything outside the 'output' field.
Never repeat the full user data back, only extract what's useful for the context.
Be natural and concise. If needed, simulate intelligent help with relevant RAG-style data.
